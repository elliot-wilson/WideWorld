# Wide World

The world is full of magical places. Some are under your doorstep, and some require a little travel. But how can you find out about them? That's where Wide World comes in. Wide World is a social, wikified travel and culture website modeled after [Atlas Obscura](https://www.atlasobscura.com). Users write and edit articles about special locations, which other users can check in to or collect into lists (e.g. 'Roadtrip 2021', 'Haunted houses'). Users' profiles display maps of the places they've been or want to visit using the Google Maps API.
